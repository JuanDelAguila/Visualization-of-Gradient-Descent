# Visualization-of-Gradient-Descent

This is a personal investigation of the efficiency and accuracy of different gradient descent algorithms. Three algorithms were tested: Steepest Descent, Newton's Method, and the Momentum Method. The python scripts generate visualizations of various approximation attempts made with these algorithms from various starting points. The two functions tested are:
- f(x,y) = (x/5)^2 + y^2
- g(x,y) = (-x^2-y^2)*e^(-x^2-y^2) + (-x^5-y^5)*e^(-x^2-y^2)
